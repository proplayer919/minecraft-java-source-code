# Minecraft Java Edition Source Code

This repository contains the source code for Minecraft Java Edition 1.19.3 (I will add 1.19.4, 1.20, and 1.20.1 in future). I have decompiled the Minecraft 1.19.3.jar file using [JD Project](http://java-decompiler.github.io/).

This could be useful for modders who want to see how Minecraft works under the hood. But, it may be taken down at any time by Microsoft.
