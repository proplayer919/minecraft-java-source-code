# Minecraft Java Edition 1.19.3 Source Code

This repository contains the source code for Minecraft Java Edition 1.19.3. I have decompiled the Minecraft 1.19.3.jar file using [JD Project](http://java-decompiler.github.io/).

This could be useful for modders who want to see how Minecraft works under the hood. But, it may be taken down at any time by Microsoft.
